# JavaScript Single Page App

## Requirements

- Use JavaScript to solve this problem. If you would like, you can use a JavaScript library like jQuery or a MV* framework such as Backbone, Angular, or Ember.
- Send us back a Github link to the project with proper commit messages.

## Bonus

- Use vanilla JavaScript -- if you don't need a library, show us!
- Use a templating language of your choice for displaying results (i.e. Handlebars, Underscore, etc.)
- Use routing on your app, and possibly even HTML5 pushState
- Though a backend is not required for this challenge, feel free to incorporate additional features (perhaps with Ruby on Rails, or Node w/ Hapi.js)
- Add some style! Use Bootstrap or Foundation, or design your own front-end.

## Note on OMDB:

*The OMDB API is a nice API to use, however some of the images from the movie results may not be hotlinkable outside of localhost. Don't worry about this for now.*
